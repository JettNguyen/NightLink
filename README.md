# [NightLink](https://jettnguyen.github.io/NightLink)

A web client for a dream-sharing community. It mixes a private journal, a “people you follow” feed, and optional anonymous sharing so you can post without oversharing.

## Features

- Log dreams with titles, tags, and visibility settings (private, public, anonymous, or people you follow)
- Browse personal history or jump into the social feed to see what your circle published
- Lightweight PWA: installable, works offline-ish, and fast on phones

## Tech Stack

React 18 + Vite, Firebase Auth/Firestore, and a tiny Netlify Function for AI summaries (coming soon).
